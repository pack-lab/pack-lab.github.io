Our lab features a state-of-the-art indoor flight arena designed for high-precision robotics research, multi-agent coordination, and autonomous system validation. This controlled environment allows for the rapid prototyping of aerial and ground vehicles in a safe, instrumented setting.

### **Spatial Dimensions**

The facility offers a significant flight volume, accommodating everything from micro-UAVs to larger industrial platforms:

* **Floor Area:** 7.2m x 7.2m
* **Vertical Clearance:** 4m
* **Safety Infrastructure:** Fully enclosed high-durability netting to ensure operator safety and equipment protection during experimental flights.

### **Motion Capture System: OptiTrack Flex 13**

To support research in complex control laws and multi-agent systems, the arena is integrated with a professional-grade tracking cluster.

| Feature | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| **Camera Count** | 12 OptiTrack Flex 13 Cameras |
| **Positional Accuracy** | ±0.5mm |
| **Sampling Rate** | 120 FPS |
| **Latency** | Sub-millisecond data streaming |

This system provides "ground truth" state estimation for vehicles in real-time. The high frame rate and sub-millimeter accuracy are critical for:

* **Aggressive Maneuvers:** Tracking high-speed trajectories without losing marker lock.
* **Swarm Robotics:** Monitoring the relative positions of multiple agents simultaneously.
* **System Identification:** Capturing fine-grained vibrational and aerodynamic data for model validation.

### **Research Applications**

Our facility is currently utilized for projects involving:

* **Vision-Based Navigation:** Testing VLM and SLAM algorithms against high-fidelity ground truth.
* **Distributed Control:** Validating multi-agent consensus and formation flight.
* **Human-Robot Interaction:** Safe testing of collaborative robotics in a shared workspace.
