We are thrilled to announce that Ramon Becerra-Orozco, along with his dedicated Faculty Advisor, Dr. Tairan Liu, has been selected as a recipient of the prestigious 2025 CSULB Student Summer Research Award. This award, now in its 12th year, is a collaborative initiative sponsored by Academic Affairs and the Office of Research & Economic Development, designed to promote exceptional student research.

The award selection process was rigorous. The review committee carefully assessed each application based on several key criteria, including student eligibility, the strength of the faculty mentor’s recommendation, and financial need. Despite receiving a multitude of highly meritorious submissions, budgetary constraints allowed for only 34 awards to be funded this year. Ramon’s proposal not only stood out for its academic excellence and innovation but also reflected the strong support and enthusiasm of his Faculty Advisor, underscoring the promise of a successful research project.

Congratulations to Ramon Becerra-Orozco on this remarkable achievement. We look forward to witnessing the exciting research and contributions that will emerge from this initiative.
