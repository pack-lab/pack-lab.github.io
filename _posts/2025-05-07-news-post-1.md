California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) has recently featured groundbreaking research led by faculty member Dr. Tairan Liu in a news story celebrating student-faculty collaborations in aerospace engineering and robotics. Titled “These Students Built a Rocket, a Satellite, and a National Reputation,” the article showcases several high-impact projects that are pushing the boundaries of student-led innovation—and two of them stem directly from Dr. Liu’s research lab.

The second and fourth projects in the article are part of Dr. Liu’s ongoing initiatives focused on multi-agent systems and CubeSat development. These projects reflect not only technical excellence but also the deep commitment to hands-on learning, equity, and interdisciplinary exploration that defines CSULB’s engineering and computing programs.

Dr. Liu’s multi-agent systems research explores how autonomous drones and robotic agents can be coordinated to perform complex tasks collaboratively—ranging from environmental monitoring to disaster response. In parallel, the CubeSat project empowers students to design and build miniature satellites for low-earth orbit, giving them real-world experience in aerospace systems, communications, and mission control.

“These projects are more than technical demonstrations,” Dr. Liu said. “They represent the future of collaborative engineering—where learning, research, and societal impact intersect.”

By being featured in the university’s coverage, these initiatives not only affirm the growing national reputation of CSULB’s STEM programs but also spotlight the transformative role of faculty-student collaboration in producing the next generation of innovators.
