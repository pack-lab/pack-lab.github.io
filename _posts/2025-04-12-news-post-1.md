On April 12, 2025, Dr. Tairan Liu, delivered an engaging and thought-provoking talk titled “The Invisible Blueprint: How Math Shapes the World of Engineering.”

The talk invited math teachers in the greater Los Angeles region to look beyond the surface of today’s technologies—robotics, autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture, Mars exploration—and uncover the mathematical foundations that power them. While motors, circuits, and materials bring machines to life physically, it’s the math behind the scenes—equations, algorithms, and models—that gives these systems intelligence, agility, and purpose.

“Math isn’t just solving equations,” Dr. Liu emphasized. “It’s solving problems that matter—from navigating rough terrain with autonomous robots to designing sustainable infrastructure and optimizing renewable energy systems.”

The talk walked the audience through key mathematical concepts such as kinematics, dynamics, control theory, optimization, perception, and motion planning, explaining how each forms an essential part of the engineering toolbox. Through real-world case studies—from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse to NASA’s Mars drone Ingenuity and modern-day robotic manipulators—the talk illustrated how math serves as the invisible blueprint for progress and innovation.

In addition to showcasing how math drives current technologies, the presentation also highlighted emerging trends. These include AI-augmented design, digital twins, and machine learning, all of which rely on mathematical models to automate, optimize, and elevate modern engineering practices.

The event concluded with a call to action for students, educators, and professionals alike: to recognize mathematics not as an abstract hurdle, but as a creative and powerful tool for shaping the future.
