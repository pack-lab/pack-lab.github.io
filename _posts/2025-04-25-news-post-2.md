We are proud to announce that Steve Maldonado-Melendez has been awarded Second Place at the Second MAE Research Symposium for his outstanding research presentation. His project, titled "An Output Feedback Augmented-State Extended Kalman Filter Robust-MRAC Scheme," showcases innovative work in the field of system and control.

Steve’s research focuses on enhancing the robustness and performance of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) systems through an augmented-state extended Kalman filter approach. His work offers significant contributions toward developing more reliable and efficient control systems for dynamic, uncertain environments — an area critical to advancements in aerospace, robotics, and autonomous systems.

Please join us in congratulating Steve on this well-deserved recognition for his hard work and academic excellence!
