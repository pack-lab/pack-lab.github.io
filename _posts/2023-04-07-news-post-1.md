The PACK Lab hosted a workshop for the Engineering Girls @ the Beach Day on April 7, 2023.

This workshop aims to introduce students to the present and future of robotics, discuss potential applications, and inspire them to explore this exciting field further. Through the presentation, interactive discussions, and hands-on activities, students learned about the different types of robots, their capabilities, and the latest advancements in robotics technology. They also learned about how robots were already making a difference in the world and how they could help solve some of the biggest challenges we face.

A tour of the laboratory and hands-on activity of robot operation was provided.
